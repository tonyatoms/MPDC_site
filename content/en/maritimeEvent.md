+++ 
Inspired by the great work of [Our Great Rivers](http://greatriverschicago.com/index.html), in conjunction with the Chicago Maritime Museum we are happy to present a panel discussion on the Past, Present, and Future of McKinley Park's eastern border, Bubbly Creek. 

Join us on August 22, doors open at 6:30pm with a panel discussion beginning at 7pm. Get there early to meet some neighbors and enjoy some light food and drink. Admission is free (but donations to the museum will be welcome).
