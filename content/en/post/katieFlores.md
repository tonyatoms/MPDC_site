Saturday, July 31st

Memorial Ceremony at 1:00PM

Join the Flores family in celebrating the life of MPDC founding board member Katie Flores in two of their favorite places. A Memorial Ceremony will take place at McKinley Park, near the Lagoon at 1:00PM. We will have approximately 100 chairs, arranged in both rows and socially-distanced, but feel free to bring your own lawn chair (please, no blankets).

Parking will be available at the McKinley Park Fieldhouse (southwest corner of the park, off Pershing Rd) and on the south side of 37th Street.  To minimize walking, we suggest being dropped off on 37th Street (between S Leavitt St and S Hamilton Ave).  Look for signage on the walking paths to guide you to the memorial ceremony location.

Reception at 2:00PM

After the ceremony, we will go to the McKinley Community Play Garden (3518 S Wolcott Ave, Chicago, IL 60609) for drinks, snacks, and of course, play!  Street parking is available along 35th Street and neighborhood streets near the Play Garden.

Before the ceremony: Please take some time to let us know what you will remember most about Katie by completing this form.  Some will be shared during the ceremony, but all will be collected in a digital presentation.
Please bring printed photos, drawings, and/or hand crafted notes for the memory wall at the Play Garden. There will also be a craft table at the Play Garden to create items for the memory wall. 
If you would like to say a few words about Katie, there will be a spot at the Play Garden where you can record a video message. These will be compiled into a video that can be viewed by friends and family.

Kids are welcome to both the ceremony and reception. Both events will be outdoors and in the grass â€” please dress accordingly! No formal wear necessary  :) . In the event of rain, both events will be held at the McKinley Park Fieldhouse (southwest corner of the park, off Pershing Rd).
