We will be hosting a public on Wednesday, May 19th at 7pm. The meeting will be held virtually. If you are on our mailing list, you should have already received an email with the meeting link and call in information. (If you are not on the mailing list,  <a href="mailto:mckinleyparkdevelopmentcouncil@gmail.com?Subject=Inquiry%20from%20Website" target="_top">let us know via email</a></strong> and we'll add you to our list.)

We've received a number of updates regarding various projects, efforts, and developments in the neighborhood that we'd like to share with you all. Just to highlight a few, we have updates on the street rendering and truck route designation status of 35th Street, the TOD development at Archer and Leavitt, the housing development at 2139 and 2159 W Pershing, and many other projects. We'll try to answer as many questions as possible with the information that we have. 

We will also be talking about some of our ongoing efforts for the neighborhood and some new endeavors that we are undertaking. One endevor being the formation of a NEW transit oriented development committee. Anyone interested is welcome to be a part of the committee. 

As always, if you have any questions, please let us know. Otherwise we'll see you on Wednesday.
