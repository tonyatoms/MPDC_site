**What:** Fall Fun Riverwalk Event Hosted by MPDC

**When:** Sunday, Oct 22 from 2-4 PM on the Riverwalk 

**Where:** Behind the Halsted L stop (see flyer for map)

**Why:** As you may know, we are currently designing for an expansion of the riverfront path from Western Ave to Ping Tom Park. What better way to get excited about this initiative than spending some time with neighbors on the riverwalk? 

**Details:** Urban Rivers will be with us to talk about their floating islands and wildlife along the South Branch. There will also be activities for all ages and an opportunity to participate in designing the new sections of the riverwalk. 

We will be offering fall treats from the three neighborhoods that we hope to connect with this riverfront path: McKinley Park, Bridgeport, and Chinatown. Interpretation will be available during the event in Spanish and Mandarin.

Please share the attached flyers (Spanish and Chinese below) to spread the word. 

Come enjoy the riverfront and bring a friend or neighbor- all are welcome to this free event!
