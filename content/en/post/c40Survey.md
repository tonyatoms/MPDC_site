The City of Chicago's Department of Planning and Development (DPD) is hoping you will take some time to complete this survey regarding your priorities for the future redevelopment of 1717-1819 W. Pershing Road, the site in McKinley Park for the C40 Reinventing Cities competition.  
The survey is located at this link: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QMDL39K] (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/QMDL39K). Survey responses will be accepted until 5pm on November 30, 2018, and will be gathered by DPD into a report for the two shortlisted teams who are currently working on their Request for Proposal submissions.

 
The two shortlisted teams and further details on the competition can be found at [https://www.c40reinventingcities.org/en/results/](https://www.c40reinventingcities.org/en/results/)  Their Request for Proposal submissions are due at the end of February 2019, and a selection is expected in May 2019.  The selected development team would then begin their community engagement process and work with the City regarding the terms of the redevelopment project.  


C40â€™s Reinventing Cities Initiative is an unprecedented global competition intended to drive carbon neutral and resilient urban regeneration. Through this competition, C40 invites developers, entrepreneurs, architects, urban planners, designers, environmentalists, neighborhood collectives, innovators and artists to collaborate and compete for the opportunity to transform select underutilized urban spaces into new beacons of sustainability and resiliency.
