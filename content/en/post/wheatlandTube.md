## Public meeting Tuesday, Oct 3 regarding the future of the Wheatland Tube site at 4435 S Western Ave. 

While this location is not technically in McKinley Park, it's a part of Back of the Yards that many of us frequent. Redeveloping it as a distribution center would have a significant impact along Western Ave, coming into our neighborhood. This is your chance to make your voice heard! 

What: Public Meeting on redevelopment of the Wheatland Tube Site at 4435 S Western Blvd

When: Tuesday, October 3, 6:30-8PM

Where: Brighton Park Community Campus [New Chicago Park District HQ]
             4830 S Western Ave, in the Club Room

Presented by: 12th Ward Office

If you can't make it in person:  The 12th Ward will stream the meeting on their Facebook Live. Facebook event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/995703701713803/). 

Background: This property has already been sold, and Wheatland Tube is winding down operations. The new owner is proposing to transform it into a logistics facility. You can see their original plans in the deck below, dated April 2023. 

Early on, people expressed concern about traffic patterns shown in the original version. The second deck below dated August 2023 shows the developer's revised plan for traffic management on 43rd and 47th Streets. 

This proposal began under the previous alderpeople and ward lines - A lot has changed as the proposal progressed. There hasn't been consistent handling of the process, which is one reason for this public meeting. 

Why it Matters: This is community members' opportunity to speak about the proposal and ask questions about what it means for the surrounding neighborhoods. Furthermore, MPDC has been asked to make a recommendation regarding the requested zoning change, and we want your input as we do so.  

Please come, and bring a friend or neighbor!
