Normally, the meetings happen on the third Wednesday of the month, but due to the holiday we are RESCHEDULING it to the following Wednesday, November 28th. 

Our guest speaker for the evening will be a member of the  <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org">Citizen's Climate Lobby</a>. They will speak about new and existing legislation to address climate change and how it would effect residents in and around McKinley Park. We will also have updates on the CMAP neighborhood plan and MPDC's not-for-profit status. 

Hope to see you all there and have a happy Thanksgiving!
