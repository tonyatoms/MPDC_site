We are excited about our upcoming meeting, this Wednesday (February 19) at 7pm. This month we will be meeting at one of our newest neighborhood gems, Pochos Restaurant, at 2025 W 35th Street.

Pochos has generously offered to provide complimentary beverages, and several items off their new lunch menu will  be available for purchase. 

We've asked them to talk about their vision for the restaurant, their journey to opening it, and the process and challenges involved with opening a restaurant. They'll also take our questions!

This is a great chance to support a local  restaurant and get some of the behind the scenes dish on what it takes to open a restaurant in our neighborhood. 

We'll  also be getting updates on our Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning neighborhood plan, the demolition of the Wrigley Building, and of course anything you all want to discuss.
