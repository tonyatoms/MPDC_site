Please join us on Wednesday, May 15, 2019 from 7:00 to 8:30 p.m. at the National Latino Education Institute (2011 W. Pershing Road, Chicago, IL) 
as we continue our process to create a neighborhood plan for McKinley Park. The meeting will begin promptly at 7:00 pm with an overview of eight months of research, analysis, and outreach activities that have culminated into an assessment of existing  challenges and opportunities in McKinley Park. 

Following CMAPâ€™s presentation, participants will have an opportunity to share their big ideas about how we can make McKinley Park a healthy, vibrant community for years to come.

All residents, business owners, community leaders, and stakeholders are invited to participate. Join us as we continue planning for the future of McKinley Park!

Please help us get the word out by sharing this invitation flyer (also available in Spanish and Chinese) with your friends and neighbors, and post it in public locations in your community.
