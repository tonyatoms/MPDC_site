### MPDC Collaborates with UIC Again in 2023!
The MPDC is excited that we will once again be working with planning, policy and architecture students from the University of [University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)](https://uic.edu/) to plan and dream improvements for the McKinley Park Neighborhood. This year, the UIC collaboration will be focusing on 35th street. Venues and exact dates and times are yet to be determined but we wanted to give you an advance heads up of what we have so far so you can save some (tentative) dates. Note that MPDC won't have our usual public meetings in May or June so we can devote our time and attention to this collaboration.
