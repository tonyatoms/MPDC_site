Due to unforeseen and uncontrollable circumstances last week's meeting had to be postponed. The good news is that it isn't for long and that we have rescheduled it for THIS Wednesday, February 24 at 7pm. If you are on our mailing list, you should have already received an email with the meeting link and call in information. (If you are not on the mailing list,  <a href="mailto:mckinleyparkdevelopmentcouncil@gmail.com?Subject=Inquiry%20from%20Website" target="_top">let us know via email</a></strong>  and we'll add you to our list.)

The agenda remains the same and we will be talking about transit oriented development(s) (TOD), specifically what they are, what is proposed for the neighborhood, and what you as residents want for the neighborhood. Our scheduled speaker will also be the developer of the vacant lot on the southwest corner of Archer and Leavitt ( 3599 S. Archer ). They've updated their previous plan for the location and have offered to present and listen to our feedback. Likewise, we will be talking briefly about the proposed drive through development for the northeast corner (3542 S Archer) of that intersection if time permits. Both proposals were previously presented at a ward meeting and information can be found here as well as recording and community feedback form for the most recent meeting about the proposed drive through here. 

This meeting fits into the larger picture of the neighborhood plan that was developed in collaboration between MPDC, CMAP, and neighborhood residents. There's a chapter in the plan about TOD and how we as residents and stewards for our community should approach developments like these to make sure they are equitable and done in a way where they benefit the current residents. Information from that plan will be shared at the meeting.

Speaking of the neighborhood plan, it has officially been released and turned over to the neighborhood for implementation! All of the resources gathered during the process can be found on [CMAP's website here](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/programs/LTA/mckinley-park). This is a great accomplishment and we're excited to see what happens next. We've already started the rollout process with our meeting last month about the 35th Street commercial corridor, but over the next several meetings we'll be presenting information from the plan and getting a better sense of where the neighborhood priorities are through both talking with you all, and through surveys. We'll take that information and use it to help create steering committees for projects that we want to tackle, and give that information to the necessary parties for projects that can better implement the neighborhood's priorities. If you want to join a steering committee for something you're passionate about, please let us know  

Lastly, one of our current projects is the Illinois Connected Community Grant. It is a community driven broadband initiative for McKinley Park. Inequities in internet connectivity have negative effects on our community. We're developing an initiative to increase internet access and affordability in the neighborhood and need your help to determine what residents need and want. Your participation in this survey will help us identify underserved areas of our community, so we can potentially attract internet service providers with faster, more affordable, and more reliable services. 

We're excited about the future of the neighborhood, but are more excited that you all can take an active part in its shaping. 

See you Wednesday, the 24th at 7pm!

Be safe, friends!
