We hope you are all keeping as calm and healthy as possible!

Until social distancing is no longer deemed necessary, we are not holding live meetings. We plan to post a video update here later this week. Stay tuned!

During "normal" times, we make an effort to rotate our monthly meetings among local businesses and institutions in order to help support our local gems. And in this time of canceled meetings and quarantines, we want to encourage all of you to continue to support our local businesses to the extent we can do so safely! 

Be safe, friends!
