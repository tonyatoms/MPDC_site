On Wednesday, July 18, 2018, the McKinley Park Development Council (MPDC) will host a public kick-off meeting for the McKinley Park neighborhood plan at the National Latino Education Institute between 6:00 and 8:00 p.m.  At this public kick-off meeting, we want to hear what you think the McKinley Park neighborhood plan should address. 

All residents, business owners, community leaders, and other stakeholders from the community are invited to participate. Join us as we begin the process to create McKinley Parkâ€™s neighborhood plan.
