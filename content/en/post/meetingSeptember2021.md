The MPDC will be having a public meeting to discuss all the goings on since our last meeting. There has been lots of activity taking place in the neighborhood that we would like to share with you. Everything from grant applications we have filed, to the latest on neighborhood developments, to the latest census results and ward redrawing. Please join us at:
<br/>
 7pm
 <br/>
 Wednesday (September 15th) 
 <br/>
 <br/>
 to discuss all of these and much more. As always if you have any questions, concerns, or things you think we should know about, please bring them up at the meeting. We'll do our best to get you the answers you seek. 

 The meeting will be held virtually. If you are on our mailing list, you should have already received an email with the meeting link and call in information. (If you are not on the mailing list,  <a href="mailto:mckinleyparkdevelopmentcouncil@gmail.com?Subject=Inquiry%20from%20Website" target="_top">let us know via email</a></strong> and we'll add you to our list.)
