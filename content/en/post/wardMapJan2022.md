+++ 
Every ten years, Chicago re-draws its ward maps after the census numbers are released. 
The Chicago City Council Committee on Committees and Rules will hold Public Hearings on the 2022 Ward Map Redistricting Process this week and next. One of the maps they are considering splits McKinley Park into multiple wards in an even worse way than it already is. The MPDC supports the December coalition map which keeps all of McKinley Park in one ward.

Here are the hearings dates and times:

Friday, January 7, 2022 11:00 A.M.

Tuesday, January 11, 2022 1:00 P.M.

Thursday, January 13, 2022 10:00 A.M.

Friday, January 21, 2022 10:00 A.M.

Here are some instruction on [How to register for public comment at a committee meeting](https://www.chicityclerk.com/city-council-news-central/council-agenda#process). Only the pre-registered will be allowed to speak.
