We will be hosting a public on Wednesday, April 21st at 7pm.  The meeting topic will be about housing and the different methods / tools available to the community to keep housing affordable for current and new residents. If you are on our mailing list, you should have already received an email with the meeting link and call in information. (If you are not on the mailing list,  <a href="mailto:mckinleyparkdevelopmentcouncil@gmail.com?Subject=Inquiry%20from%20Website" target="_top">let us know via email</a></strong> and we'll add you to our list.)

We will have two speakers at the Wednesday meeting. First, we will have a representative from the Pilsen Housing Cooperative (PIHCO) speak to us about co-op housing, its benefits, and how it works. 

The second will be a representative from the City's Department of Housing (DOH). DOH staff will specifically address their new revision to the City's Affordable Requirements Ordinance. This revision calls for expanding the requirements for ARO housing units in developments and has a new focus on anti-displacement measures for residents, among other things. This is especially important as the neighborhood has seen increased interest in creating new TOD and various multi-unit residential building proposals. It will be a highly informative meeting. As always there will be time for questions and dialog with our speakers so don't be shy if you have questions and comments. 

We hope to see you on Wednesday the 21th at 7pm!

Be safe, friends!
