### Development Proposal
On Wednesday, September 21st, at 6:30 at the McKinley Park Library (1915 W 35th St) we'll be having our September public meeting. The main topic for the evening will be a neighborhood development proposal for the northeast corner of Pershing Rd and Ashland Ave (3815 S Ashland Ave). 

The current proposal is for the existing building to be torn down and replaced with an ultra cold storage facility. The developers as well as representatives from the 11th Ward will be at the meeting to both present the proposal and listen to community comments and questions. If you have any questions or concerns about this development, we urge you to come to the meeting and express them directly to our speakers. 

### Open Board Positions
The second topic we will briefly talk about during the meeting is how you can get more involved with MPDC. We're currently looking for a few people to fill some open board positions. If you want to be more involved with us, engage with, and give back to your community, we welcome you to come to the meeting and find out more information.
