Normally we have our monthly meeting on the second Wednesday of the month, to discuss new projects, opportunities, and developments in the neighborhood. 

This month (May, 2022), we are doing something different. Our big collaboration with [UIC's Urban Planning Department](https://cuppa.uic.edu/) begins this week, and we need you to be a part of it!  UIC's graduate students in architecture and city design are here to help us re-envision 35th Street and the area around the 35th/Archer L stop, including new housing on the vacant lot immediately north of it.  We need your help to decide what 35th Street should become in the future!!

We will be having two highly-interactive public events (with snacks!):

Thursday, June 2 and Friday, June 10 
6:30 PM 
[Aquinas Literacy Center](https://aquinasliteracycenter.org/) - 1751 W 35th St

Both events will be livestreamed, but we encourage you to come in person and participate hands on

On the 2nd, we will be working together with the students as a community, discussing different ideas for 35th St and the area around the L.  We will also see student drawings and give feedback on them.  

On the 10th, the students will showcase their final work to the community (you!), as well as representatives from various city departments who can help make them a reality. 

This is a great opportunity to guide the neighborhood into a future created by you, our residents.  Please come and be a part of shaping these projects!

If you want to be further involved in the process, we are also looking for volunteers to commit a few hours to working tables around the neighborhood with students who will be asking residents about their hopes and dreams for the neighborhood.  These events will take place at several times and locations between 28 May and 5 June. We especially need bilingual volunteers in all the languages of our neighborhood: Spanish, Mandarin, and Cantonese. <a href="mailto:mckinleyparkdevelopmentcouncil@gmail.com?Subject=Inquiry%20from%20Website" target="_top">Send us an email</a></strong> and we can tell you more. 

Please share this announcement with your friends and neighbors. 

Looking forward to seeing all of you in person at Aquinas.  Together, we can do great things!
