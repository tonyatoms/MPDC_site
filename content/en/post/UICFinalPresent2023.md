+++ 
We were thrilled to spend time with so many of you at the workshop with  [University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)](https://uic.edu/)'s [Urban Planning and Public Affairs](https://cuppa.uic.edu) graduate students on May 31.  

You voiced your opinions through engaging hands-on activities and hopefully met a few neighbors as we examined possibilities for the revitalization of 35th Street and enjoyed a tasty spread from Chile Toreado restaurant!

Even if you couldn't make it to the workshop, we invite you to join us for the culminating event of this summer's collaboration with UIC:

What: Final Presentations 

Where: 3532 S Hoyne Ave  - [Bethany Baptist Church](https://www.bethanychicago.org)

When: Friday June 9th, 6:30 PM

Why: Discuss design and policy recommendations for revitalizing 35th St, developed by the class based on research and community input.

Food: [Gorditas Tia Susy](https://gorditaslatiasusy.com) and [Cadinho Bakery](https://www.facebook.com/cadinhobakery/)

There will be activities for children. Interpretation will be available in Spanish and Mandarin.

We are also delighted to feature two more McKinley Park businesses at this event: [Gorditas Tia Susy](https://gorditaslatiasusy.com), recently featured in the Chicago Tribune, will provide their unique Durango-style burritos. [Cadinho Bakery](https://www.facebook.com/cadinhobakery/) will be offering up their signature pasteis de nata, as well as some other tantalizing sweets. 

We hope you'll come out for another evening of intriguing discussion, great conversations, and delicious food. Bring a neighbor!
