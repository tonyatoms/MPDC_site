Chicago needs more healthy, walkable, bikeable, and affordable neighborhoods. MPDC is one of 11 teams whose projects will promote equitable transit-oriented development (ETOD) here. Weâ€™re part of the inaugural eTOD pilot class. Created by a partnership of Mayor Lori Lightfoot, [Elevated Chicago](https://www.elevatedchicago.org/) and [Enterprise Community Partners](https://www.enterprisecommunity.org/about/where-we-work/chicago), our project will join 10 others in accessing microgrants from a pool of $160,000 in funding, plus technical assistance to community-driven development projects near transit stations across Chicago. The pilot program created an open and transparent process for community-driven projects to access City supports and resources. Follow our work here, and learn more about the program at [https://chi.gov/etod](https://chi.gov/etod).
