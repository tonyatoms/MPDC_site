Our next public meeting will be held via Zoom at

7pm (CDT)

March 16, 2022

### Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) Workshop 
MPDC Board members participated in a CBA workshop in January of this year.
At the workshop we presented some ideas and recommendations on how to formulate a CBA.
A CBA could especially help neighborhood with larger developments potentially including our manufacturing districts on Pershing and Ashland. We will review the workshop and look forward to hearing your thoughts on the topic.

### Ashland eTOD corridor 
The MPDC is collaborating with The University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) to host some workshops this summer for envisioning what we would like to see happen in our Transit Oriented Development (TOD) areas. We will update the community on this collaboration during the meeting on Wednesday. The specific areas that UIC will be focusing on are:

- 35th/Leavitt empty lot
- 35th/Archer Orange line
- Portions of 35th Street	

### Industrial Corridor Study
The City of Chicago is developing a plan for modernizing the industrial corridors. A couple of MPDC Board members participated in a recent listening session hosted by the City. We will review and discuss what we've learned about the Southwest Industrial Corridors and the concerns we expressed.  

Here is the map that the Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) is using to gather and track community input on the corridors:
