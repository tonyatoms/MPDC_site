The McKinley Park Development Council was founded with the mission to collectively foster economic, cultural and social development through the connection of residents, institutions and enterprises for the benefit of the McKinley Park neighborhood of Chicago. 

We at the McKinley Park Development Council stand against the systems that lead to the tragedies of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Laquan McDonald, and so many more. We acknowledge these injustices and we hope to work together as an organization with our staff, friends, local police and supporters on how to establish real and significant change in our community. 

We acknowledge the platform we have and vow to use it from here on out to speak against systemic violence and oppression so Chicago can be safer for ALL COMMUNITIES no matter their race, color, or creed. We are fortunate to be part of a vibrant, historic, creative community on Chicagoâ€™s near Southwest Side. We remain committed in our own work and through partnerships to support practices that seek truth, promote equity, and strive for justice.

The MPDC strives to conduct its work in a neighborhood where no-one would have to say that Black Lives Matter, a country where a pandemic would not kill black people at obscenely higher rates than white people. We strive to work in a country where police accountability is ingrained and ever-present.  We strive to live in a city where all people are treated with equal dignity and respect. But we do not yet live in that world. Until we do, the MPDC stands in solidarity with the peaceful protest movement for racial justice and with those who work together to improve police and community relationships for a better future. 

Black Lives Matter!
