In lieu of our usual monthly MPDC meeting, we urge McKinley Park residents and other interested parties to attend the community meeting on the chicken processing facility proposed for a site on Ashland immediately north of the Ashland Avenue CTA station.

The meeting hosted by 25th Ward Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez and 11th Ward Alderman Patrick D. Thompson is at 6:00 PM, Wednesday, November 20 at the Park 571 boat house.

For more information and a map, see: [Cougle Foods Development Meeting](https://mckinleypark.news/events/featured-events/event/10107-cougle-foods-development-meeting) at the (McKinely Park News) 

Also, you may recall that we had originally planned to release a draft of the McKinely Park Neighorhood Plan on November 20, 2019, but the plan's relase has been delayed. Work on the plan by CMAP is ongoing and we'll have updates about it here soon.
