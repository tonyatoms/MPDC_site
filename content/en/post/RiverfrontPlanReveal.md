Join us on Wednesday, June 12, as we present our [new riverfront plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16KlWoSpr6mFV42jsHN469gbfLROch0_9/view?usp=sharing) at the McKinley Park Library.  Over 600 neighbors were part of the events leading up to this community-driven plan, and we’re so excited to share it with you! 

**What:** South Branch Connectivity Project: Framework Plan launch!

**Where:**  McKinley Park Library

**When:** Wed, 12 Jun at 6:30 PM

****Why it’s exciting:**  Neighbors have worked together for an entire year, finding ways to connect parks, expand greenspace, and create new opportunities for transportation and recreation on the riverfront. Now it’s time to show what a connected path could look like, and how we can make it a reality!

**What to expect:** We’ll give an overview of the plan and have a conversation about what’s next, including MPDC’s new partnership with the National Park Service. We’ll also have snacks and beverages. School-age kids are welcome. 

Please join us, and bring a friend or neighbor!

Your Friends at MPDC
