The McKinley Park Development Council’s annual  Board of Directors election for 2020 is complete and we are happy to announce that the results bring both new energy and perspective to the council.

We want to first thank all of the nominees. This year's selection was a highly diverse group of extremely qualified candidates and the neighborhood is lucky to have you. Your willingness to volunteer is appreciated and we encourage you and more residents to continue to be involved in your community. 

Board President John Belcik will remain on the board and the following five candidates will join the board for their three year term:

- Kate Eakin
- John Kugler
- Sandra Ramirez
- Salvador G. Santillan
- Anthony Wojtal

Current board members: Tony Adams, John Belcik, Dan Covarrubias, Liz Gres, Jim Hankes, Mary Carmen Moreno and Faye “Nikita” Wu look forward to working closely with the newly elected board members to help the McKinley Park neighborhood continue to build, grow, and shape its bright future.

The MPDC thanks the neighbors who took the time to attend the virtual meeting or watch the meeting video, review the candidate bios, and then vote for the candidates they thought would best serve McKinley Park. Our goal is to always more accurately reflect the best aspects of our community, and with this board election, we are moving forward toward that goal.

The next meeting for the Development Council will be on  December 16th where we intend to be celebrating the release of the final draft of the neighborhood plan that you all contributed to over the last two plus years. This is the start of a new journey and we are excited to see where it takes us. See you all on the 16th!
