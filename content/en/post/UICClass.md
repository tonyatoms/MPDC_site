### UIC TOD Planning Collaboration 
The MPDC is excited to note that our collaboration with the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) begins on Monday, May 15, 2022.  We will be hosting workshops for envisioning what we would like to see happen in our Transit Oriented Development (TOD) areas. The specific areas that UIC will be focusing on are:

- 35th/Leavitt empty lot
- 35th/Archer Orange line
- Portions of 35th Street
