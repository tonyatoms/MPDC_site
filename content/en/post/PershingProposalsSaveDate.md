Please see [this overview of the meeting](https://view.citynews.chicago.gov/?qs=9fa074f4b8998040d1d51543d4f1a83d78d7d2772a9441a245f644d7a11816ecacfe2ed4936046fe64cecfbab97921f54821f154e655ebbfeea58d1373969a290f4a450a5f78095d4b1fdf5298c2fb2e) from DPD. Folks can register directly at this [link](https://click.citynews.chicago.gov/?qs=0b3e53b0a44766e1876c5b04b5d216fd9f2e1e62cc14930900ffeb0e050c7641265f47035acdf71093c72057b11e0bc25d4f2896dca30c57). 

As you learn about the three shortlisted proposals, please consider how each one would impact the overall quality of life in our community. Specifically, which proposal does the most to...

Make our neighborhood more walkable and bikeable?

Preserve the architecture and character of the CMD?

Make space in the CMD more open to area residents?

Create opportunities for small businesses owned by area residents?

Provide housing for working families?

Increase public green space and outdoor amenities?

Set a welcome precedent for land use in the rest of the CMD?

Transform Pershing Rd into a vibrant place where people will want to live, play, work and shop?

You may also want to consider how much demolition each proposal will involve, and which developer we trust to complete the building renovations in a safe and timely manner. 

Whatever your questions or concerns about the proposals are, we look forward to hearing them at the meeting next week. In the meantime, please reach out with any questions you may have about the event.
