1. We hope you are all keeping as calm and healthy as possible!

2. We are canceling our March 18 meeting, in order to help each other maintain the social distance that will kick this pandemic out of the park!

3. We make an effort to rotate our monthly meetings among local businesses and institutions in order to help support our local gems. And in this time of canceled meetings and quarantines, we want to encourage all of you to continue to support our local businesses! Some standouts, this week, include: 
Our March meeting host, Kristoffer's Cakes delivers their excellent cake and muffins and tamales to your door. Perfect comfort food! 

Two other local restaurants have been getting rave reviews in the news this week - and while they don't deliver, both allow you to order in advance and pick up, if you prefer to eat at home: 
Pochos Chicago - who hosted are February meeting - are on the March Hot List of Chicago magazine 

Chile Toreado was covered in the Chicago Tribune this week
Let's show ALL of our neighborhood businesses some love - including our local grocery stores, who have been helping many of us stock up :)
