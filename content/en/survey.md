## Community Broadband Survey

McKinley Park Connected Communities is a community-driven broadband initiative for McKinley Park.

Inequities in internet connectivity have negative effects on our community. The McKinley Park Development Council is developing an initiative to increase internet access and affordability in the neighborhood. We need your help to determine what residents need and want.

Your participation in this survey will help us identify underserved areas of our community, so we can attract internet service providers with faster, more affordable, and more reliable services.

Thanks for helping!
