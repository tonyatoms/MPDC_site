# Current (Founding) Board Members

## Tony Adams

This year I've been busy as part of the leadership team of the McKinley Park Community Garden as we've relocated to the new site in McKinley Park. I am also one of MPDC founders - involved since before it existed as a named group. I'm a particpant in the McKinley Park Stewardship days (not just because of the doughnuts) , Ward cleanup events and a customer of the Farmer's Market. I consider it a huge blessing to be able to live here. 

By trade I am a software developer and have been contributing those talents to the project by designing, maintaining and hosting this web site (using 100% free and open source tools).

## John Belcik

Born and raised in McKinley Park. Being a fifth generation resident, McKinley Park is deeply ingrained in me and my family and will always call it home. I'm always trying to make the neighborhood a better place for old and new residents be it volunteering time to help with the Farmer's Market, teaching the McKinley Park Advisory Council's outdoor ecology class, to working to create the McKinley Park Development Council. 

When I am not in the neighborhood, I work as a biologist in the Planning and Environment Branch of the Chicago District of the US Army Corps of Engineers and am currently getting a PhD in ecology from University of Illinois at Chicago.

## [Kara Breems](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kara-breems-17755559/) 

I have been a homeowner in McKinley Park since 2004. I love that McKinley Park is an oasis of diversity and down-to-earthness, a small town in our big city, and my volunteer efforts within the neighborhood aim to celebrate and cultivate those things. Those efforts have included work to help create a community garden and the McKinley Park Development Council.

My work-related background is in urban planning and affordable housing, and my day job is with the City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development.

## Justin Kerr

Hi! My name is Justin Kerr, and I’ve been involved with the McKinley Park Development Council since a group of neighbors got together following the April and May 2017 community meetings about a potential development project along Pershing Road. Since then, I’ve been involved on an ongoing basis with the meetings, planning and programs for this group, which has turned into the McKinley Park Development Council. I continue to serve as an ad hoc founding board member and would look forward to continuing to serve an initial founding board member term.

I have been a resident of the McKinley Park neighborhood since 2008 and plan to continue to reside here permanently with my wife and child. I’ve been a resident of nearby neighborhoods since the mid-1990s, and first came to the Chicago area in 1989 to get my journalism degree from Northwestern University.

My professional experience has included stints in journalism, marketing and web development; I also have experience with non-profits, including serving as the executive director of the now-defunct `501(c)(3)` organization The Site of Big Shoulders. As I achieve escape velocity from being a stay-at-home dad, I’m returning professionally to journalism by developing and publishing the McKinley Park News (https://mckinleypark.news), a hyper-local publication that focuses exclusively on the McKinley Park Community Area and the Central Manufacturing District.

Much of my interest in the McKinley Park Development Council has centered around the neighborhood’s business and business development environment, both to connect businesses and development interests to residents and the wider community, and to offer business services to support and improve the local economic environment. Likewise, I hope to leverage my experience in founding and organizing an all-volunteer `501(c)(3)` non-profit toward organizational development of the McKinley Park Development Council.
