# Prospective Board Membership Candidates
 
## Kate Eakin
I'm interested in being a part of the McKinley Park Development Council because I am both encouraged and concerned by various interests moving into our neighborhood.  

My professional background includes 20+ years in education and performing arts, including time as a CPS teaching artist and as faculty at Columbia College Chicago. You may have seen me onstage with the Chicago Civic Orchestra or the Air Force Band, among others.  On Active Duty in the Air Force, I worked in public relations across three continents.  I also taught communication and conflict resolution skills to both new recruits and seasoned leaders.  

More recently, I went back to school for my MBA, which I completed at UIC earlier this year.  I now work in Accenture Consulting's Public Service division, where I help organizations plan and execute change.  In functional terms, I help groups get to the root of the problem, determine a course forward, and then build training programs to grow skills and improve communications.  I am also still serving in the Air Force Reserve as a paralegal.

As for my experience in the neighborhood, I moved back to the South Side in 2018 after leaving Active Duty overseas.  In February of 2019, I bought my McKinley Park fixer upper - a 2 flat near Honore and Pershing.  

The most striking thing I encountered in my home buying was experience was seeing just how fast Pilsen had gentrified while I was away.  I was dismayed to see so many long time residents selling because the neighborhood no longer felt like home.  Certainly, I could no longer afford to live in the same area where I had my first apartment, years ago. I don't want to see the same thing happen in McKinley Park.

Likewise, I don't want to see our safety threatened by development that would increase pollution and other environmental hazards.  The fight against MAT asphalt has shown that we can organize to push back against such forces, and recent developments in that fight are encouraging. 

All that said, it is entirely possible to have curated development that supports existing residents and builds on our neighborhood's strengths.  We can move forward on affordable housing.  We can work with businesses to bring opportunities for work and play commensurate with the skills and desires of our residents, without sacrificing the character and affordability of the neighborhood.  

Shaping the future of our neighborhood in this way is something I very much want to be a part of.  Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Kate Eakin


## John Kugler

I am nominating myself (John Kugler) to be on the McKinley Park Development Council.
 
We have lived at 3701 S. Winchester for 23 years, consequently seeing and being part of many changes in our neighborhood. Husband of Emi Yamamoto, we raised 4 boys together who all attended Greene ES, Evergreen Middle ES and Juarez HS. Starting with Twinkle Star Gymnastics, our family participated in sports at McKinley Park Field House. I say this to validate my involvement in our neighborhood in everyday life needs and services, which also includes my civic service on the Greene ES LSC and Judge of Election in my Precinct. 

The reason I would like to be involved with the council is my concern that unchecked development will disenfranchise middleclass families and push out mom and pop businesses.
 
Some ideas of mine, as a lifelong Chicago resident for responsible and sustainable neighborhood development are:
 
Bringing back corner stores and hyper-local businesses inside of our blocks
Safe traffic patterns before neighborhood expansion begins
Positive afterschool and employment opportunities for our youth
Integrated senior friendly activities and services
Improve immigrant supports and infrastructure
Supporting and promoting neighborhood schools and churches
Re-purposing industrial land for:
Low cost rental space for businesses
Local produce growing
Training centers for emerging technologies
Incubators for neighborhood entrepreurs
 
Having experienced rampant gentrification in Lakeview and Bucktown, I feel if we don’t get ahead of the curve in McKinley Park, none of us will be living here 20 years from now.


## Kevin O'Neil

I would like to be considered as a board member for the McKinley Park Development Council.

In March my wife and I bought a three-flat graystone on Western Blvd. south of 35th Street. We live there with our daughter and her fiancé, with some friends in another unit. We are currently finishing up some rehab. 

I retired last year from my job as chief of staff for former 49th Ward Ald. Joe Moore. Prior to that I was working in marketing and communications for the American Medical Assn. for 29 years. 

I also have been a volunteer community leader and organizer for many years. For 18 years I was a CAPS beat facilitator in Rogers Park. My efforts in conjunction with police and other stakeholders resulted in a sharp crime reduction in my neighborhood.

Also, I served as board president for a non-profit community development organization - formerly called DevCorp North, now named Rogers Park Business Alliance. During that time the organization partnered with a private developer to build a much-needed shopping center with a supermarket in Rogers Park.

I am well-versed in zoning laws. I served for 10 years as chairman of Ald. Moore’s zoning advisory committee. 

I believe that both my professional and volunteer experience and accomplishments qualify me to join your board.

I look forward to working with you and other board members to continue making McKinley Park a great place to live, work and raise a family. Thank you for the consideration.

Sincerely,

Kevin O'Neil

## Anthony Wojtal

Greetings McKinley Park neighbors, MPDC members, and to the Board,

My name is Anthony Wojtal, a Chicago native and a McKinley Park resident for the past two-and-a-half years. I am a recent graduate of DePaul University’s MBA program and for the past 7 years have worked for Chicago Public Schools’ Office of Budget & Grants Management where I am currently a Budget Manager. I am writing to you today to offer my candidacy for the board of directors of the McKinley Park Development Council.

If the past 9 months have taught us anything, it is that our communities are in dire need of resources and support. Even in times of stability, many families may find themselves one paycheck away from not getting by - a reality made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn. This is a moment where we must turn our attention and extend solidarity to the struggle of working families, and harness the collective power of the community to direct resources to those who are in need. A community that sustainably ensures basic needs and rights are met and protected will generate more economic activity, improve general well-being, and be better suited to weather any national economic impacts. To this end, I believe there are several critical areas where we must develop policies that aim to protect and expand the rights of working families: Housing, Healthcare, Food Security, and Education. 

Housing: We must work to ensure no person who calls McKinley Park or Chicago “home”, faces eviction, or finds a lack of available affordable housing. To promote home ownership, expand accessibility and security, and increase the stock of affordable housing, we must explore financing alternatives such as mortgage revenue bonds, promote the right to form housing cooperatives, and push to expand tenants’ rights.

Healthcare: While much of this struggle will ultimately fall on the federal government to address, we as a community can still come together to ensure the health and well-being of the community is cared for. Especially in the midst of a pandemic with little federal guidance, people all around us, especially working people, desperately need resources like PPE, medicines, available testing, and access to immediate care. We must work together to direct resources to those in need through community fund raising, donation drives, and the creation of rapid test sites. Looking forward, we must also identify ways to direct resources to ensure the community has access to health centers, access to mental health and counseling, low-cost or free health screenings, and low-cost or free medication.

Food Security: No person who calls McKinley Park or Chicago “home”, should go hungry or lack access to nutritious foods. Our neighborhood is situated in a very critical area which includes the Central Manufacturing District and while there are many plans available that explore how to best use these vast spaces, one key topic is often overlooked: Urban farming. An urban farming operation would not only address any food shortages in the immediate area, but it could also serve as a resource hub for local schools and promote home and community gardening. Additionally, redeveloping the CMD in this way will bring jobs to the area, reduce harmful emissions, and promote a framework of utilizing urban spaces in a sustainable, carbon negative way.

Education: Educational outcomes can differ greatly depending on your zip code. Expanding equity in education can be enhanced through the expansion of housing rights, and through economic development within the community. All children deserve access to a high performing neighborhood public school and we must fight to ensure equitable funding is provided to schools in order to provide nutritious meals, diverse curriculum offerings, universal childcare, and counseling and nursing services.

I appreciate your consideration of my candidacy for the MPDC board of directors. I urge you to vote for me if you believe that the key to our community’s success lies within the community itself and if you believe in a bold vision to protect and expand basic rights to ensure the future sustainability and success of our community and our city. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Anthony Wojtal

# Current Board Members Seeking Re-election

## John Belcik

Born and raised in McKinley Park. Being a fifth generation resident, McKinley Park is deeply ingrained in me and my family and will always call it home. I'm always trying to make the neighborhood a better place for old and new residents be it volunteering time to help with the Farmer's Market, teaching the McKinley Park Advisory Council's outdoor ecology class, to working to create the McKinley Park Development Council. 

When I am not in the neighborhood, I work as a biologist in the Planning and Environment Branch of the Chicago District of the US Army Corps of Engineers and am currently getting a PhD in ecology from University of Illinois at Chicago.   
  
## Justin Kerr

Hi! I’m Justin Kerr, and I’d welcome the chance to continue serving the neighborhood as a board member of the McKinley Park Development Council. 

I am a founding board member and have been continually active in the council since its first  meeting, before the group even had a name. In the more than three years that I’ve been  volunteering, my role has ranged from foundational work like helping to write the council’s mission  statement and bylaws through ongoing engagement representing the council, helping out with projects and leading as a board member. 

Currently, I am most occupied with serving as chairperson on the council committee managing the  Illinois Connected Communities project, a federally funded, statewide project the council won this  past summer. Council President John Belcik and I applied to the program this spring, rallied support
from our community institutions and elected officials, and worked with State of Illinois resources  through an intense qualification process to land the first phase of this program, which runs until  next July.  

Now, McKinley Park is one of 12 communities statewide taking part in the first cohort of this  program to enable better broadband Internet and digital literacy. In addition to recruiting our large  and growing steering committee to bring more volunteer resources to this project and well represent our neighborhood, I’ve built, launched and run the interactive McKinleyPark.org website  to provide access to and manage the project for all our Connected Communities participants. At this point in the project, we’ve honed in on two project directions, found project leads and  established other roles, and set our schedule to launch the projects in January. 

I’ve also worked very hard to grow the McKinley Park Development Council toward a full-fledged,  formally organized group that has the capacity to enable very consequential things for our  neighborhood. I conceived, authored, revised and led the formal adoption of the council’s  “committees” structure and process, which remains the sole method the council uses to manage  our operations and programs by establishing roles, responsibilities, oversight, scope, deliverables  and more. 

I also led the push this summer for the council to formally decide to expand our capacity and  activities, to allow us to have opportunities to go after bigger projects and expand our reach and  role within the neighborhood. This was actually required for us to successfully land Connected  Communities: Late in the application process, we discovered the council had to commit toward  more business-like and formal operations in order to participate. In addition, we were presented  with another major funding opportunity that also required capacity growth and operational  maturity. This summer, as a board, we conclusively voted to grow our capacity and capabilities to  allow us to participate in Connected Communities, pursue other funding and program  opportunities, formalize operations, and open up toward more growth and engagement. 

This vote enables opportunities to better engage our constituency and the wonderful human  capital that continually comes to the McKinley Park Development Council with ideas and labor, but that we as a board have squandered. We have failed to leverage all the potential, ready-to-go,  expert, engaged community members who come to us ready to help, and we haven’t followed through on several promising projects in which we engaged volunteers and their wonderful work,  but then abandoned the projects when we hit a speed bump. 

Becoming a better-organized community group – and opening up our activities, roles and  responsibilities more widely with neighborhood volunteers – is something I have been advocating  for years as a board member. We need to define some level of membership engagement so we  can organize our constituency and volunteers better, even to simply let neighbors know whether  and how they’re engaged with the council or not. We need to support productive and fulfilling  ways for volunteers to work with the council, and we can and should provide tools and a platform  to let members lead and manage their own involvement. With some basic steps that are extremely common for community groups, the council could become an amazingly effective vehicle to  enable positive change that the community wishes to collectively work toward. 

In addition to my volunteer work with the McKinley Park Development Council, I have been deeply involved in the community by publishing the McKinley Park News at https://mckinleypark.news,  reporting on our neighborhood’s news and events in one form or another since 2012. I’ve been a  homeowner in the McKinley Park neighborhood since 2008 and a resident of the Southwest Side  since the mid-1990s. 

Our family has loved McKinley Park: its fantastic present and wonderful potential future. I’d  welcome the chance to continue serving the neighborhood as a volunteer board member of the  McKinley Park Development Council and ask for your vote of support. 

Thank you for your attention and consideration. I’m happy to answer any questions, receive  feedback and get your ideas for what the council can do for the neighborhood: Send email to  justinkerr@mckinleypark.news or call (312) 560-1115.

## Faye "Nikita" Wu

My name is Faye Wu but many people know me as "Nikita". I am an active member of the school my son attends, Galileo, located in the 25th Ward where I help organize the annual fundraiser: Reach for the Stars. I have been an active member of the Chinese community for many years having been the MC of many ceremonies and galas and having worked at a prominent insurance agency. Today, I own my own business, the Faye Wu Agency of American Family Insurance located in the heart of Chinatown.

But it is McKinley Park that I have called home since 2002 and where, together with my husband and two sons, we have decided to grow even deeper roots by building an addition to our home to better accommodate our future needs and it is here that I would welcome the opportunity to serve the needs of the residents and build a better McKinley Park.

## Jim Hankes
Born and raised in McKinley Park, moved out in the mid ‘80s, moved back in 2014. My parents still live in McKinley Park and have since they moved here from Bridgeport in the 1950’s.
I’m currently a realtor with @properties with a specific focus on the McKinley Park neighborhood. It was great to see an article on Trulia.com recently that showed McKinley Park having the lowest neighborhood crime rate in Cook County. I have access to statistics and information about our neighborhood that others may not be aware of.
Along with my wife, Vickie, we conceptualized, planned, self-funded, built and operated a meal assembly kitchen in Wheaton, IL. We had a staff of 22 part-time employees.
Prior to starting the food business, I was Western Sales Manager in the trade publishing industry for 9 years, handling a 17-state territory from IL to CA.
I recently signed up to be an Ambassador for the MP Dog Park!

## Liz Gres
 I've got board and non-profit experience. I've done it all from grant-writing to strategic planning to meeting facilitation, etc. etc. More importantly, I'm a native southwest-sider, the kid of immigrants and now raising a couple kids of my own in the neighborhood. I can't say enough about how much I love the community in McKinley Park and the active work so many people are doing to foster and invite that. I think it's a pretty special thing though it can be pretty fragile when you're talking about a community that isn't as resourced or listened to as other neighborhoods given our racial and economic make-up as well as small size - especially as we begin to get mentioned as the next "hot" area. I think the MPDC can serve as an organization that really helps to hold up the voice and priorities of all of the neighborhood not just of those whose voice is loudest or who have the most access, time, resources, etc. There are certainly challenges in order to effectively do that as an organization but I think the MPDC can serve in that role and I would love to contribute to making that happen.
